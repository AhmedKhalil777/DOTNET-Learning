> Semaphore in Threading: The semaphore class lets you set a limit on the number of threads that have access to a critical section. The class is used to control access to a pool of resources. System.Threading.Semaphore is the namespace for Semaphore because it has all the methods and properties required to implement Semaphore.

- For using a semaphore in C#, you just need to instantiate an instance of a Semaphore object. It has minimum of two arguments âˆ’

|Constructor| Description|
|:---------:|:-----------|
|Semaphore(Int32,Int32)|Initializes a new instance of the Semaphore class, specifying the initial number of entries and the maximum number of concurrent entries.|
|Semaphore(Int32,Int32,String)|1 + optionally specifying the name of a system semaphore object.|
|Semaphore(Int32,Int32,String,Boolean)| 2+ specifying a variable that receives a value indicating whether a new system semaphore was created.|

- Use the Semaphore class to control access to a pool of resources.
- Threads enter the semaphore by calling the `WaitOne` method, which is inherited from the `WaitHandle` class, and release the semaphore by calling the `Release` method.
- The count on a semaphore is decremented each time a thread enters the semaphore, and incremented when a thread releases the semaphore.
- When the count is zero, subsequent requests block until other threads release the semaphore. When all threads have released the semaphore, the count is at the maximum value specified when the semaphore was created.
- There is no guaranteed order, such as FIFO or LIFO, in which blocked threads enter the semaphore.
- A thread can enter the semaphore multiple times, by calling the `WaitOne` method repeatedly.
- To release some or all of these entries, the thread can call the parameterless `Release()` method overload multiple times, or it can call the `Release(Int32)` method overload that specifies the number of entries to be released.
