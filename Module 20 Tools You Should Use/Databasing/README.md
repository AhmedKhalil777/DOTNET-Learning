# Databasing Useful Tools

## Query Express
> Query Express is a simple Query Analyzer look-alike, but being small and free it can be run where the SQL Server client tools are not installed or licensed. This makes it especially useful as a query tool for MSDE and SQL Express. It also connects to Oracle and other OLE-DB compliant databases.

> Query Express requires no installation and is packaged as a single 100KB executable. This is more than 300 times smaller than SQL Server Management Studio
